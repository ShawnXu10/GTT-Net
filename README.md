# GTT-Net: Learned Generalized Trajectory Triangulation

This is the implementation of the paper ‘[GTT-Net: Learned Generalized Trajectory Triangulation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Xu_GTT-Net_Learned_Generalized_Trajectory_Triangulation_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)’ using pytorch.

## Setup

Specific setup will come up soon

## Evaluation and testing

- Evauation on ski datasets:
'''
python ski_test.py

## Training

Specific training instruction will come soon.
